The screen is amazing, very colourful and has a high resolution. My last device was the Galaxy fold 3 i realy liked it but it\u0027s time for an upgrade after 3 years. I didnt want another folding phone not because they are bad but i wanted the better camera set up as I\u0027ve got into photography more over the past 18 months, i have a nice camera but feel i can use the S24 ultra as a back up. The Fold 6 cameras are good just not as good as on the S24 ultra. I also really like the Square look on the S24 ultra heard the up coming S25 isn\u0027t so square in appearance so would look like every other phone on the market, so bit the bullet, i also got a good deal and reduced my bill, always a good thing.",

I wasn\u0027t sure on the colour at first, it\u0027s a bit pale but actually it looks better now the case is on and it\u0027s more pastel coloured than childish yellow.... although that option would still be cool!! Have a few problems with fingerprint recognition to log in but that might be due to the protector I\u0027ve put on. Face recognition doesn\u0027t work for me but tbf my face is pretty miserable in the morning so it probably doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s me haha. Mobile data didn\u0027t work the first time I needed it but if you turn airplane mode on and off it sorts it out, well it did for me. You definitely need to get lens protectors for the cameras or they will get damaged really quickly.",
